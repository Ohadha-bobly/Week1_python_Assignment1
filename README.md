## 📋 Description

This is a beginner-friendly Python assignment designed to help you practice **basic arithmetic operations** and explore:

- User input handling  
- Conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else`  
- Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Formatted string output  
- Data types (`float`, `str`)  
- Input validation (like avoiding division by zero)

---

## 🚀 Objective

Build a basic calculator in Python that:

1. Asks the user for two numbers.
2. Prompts for a mathematical operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. Performs the operation.
4. Displays a clear and formatted result.

---

## 📌 Example

Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +
The result of 10.0 + 5.0 is: 15.0


---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How to use `input()` and convert to `float`
- Using `if-elif-else` to control logic
- Formatting output using `f-strings`
- Handling edge cases like **division by zero**
- Writing readable and commented Python code

---
